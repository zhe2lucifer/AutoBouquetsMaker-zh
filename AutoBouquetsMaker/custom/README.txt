CustomMix or CustomLCN?
-----------------------

What is the difference between CustomMix and CustomLCN?

CustomLCN is for allocating LCNs (logical channel numbers) to channels that don't have them. 
It should be considered a system file and not be used to move channels around that already 
have LCNs allocated to them. Once a channel has an LCN allocated this is persistent for the 
entire duration of the current ABM run. So that channel can later be used in a CustomMix file 
refered to by the allocated LCN.

CustomMix on the other hand, is for moving channels around, either within one provider or 
from one provider to another. It only affects what is written in the bouquets of the current 
provider and is not persistent. i.e.. if you move a channel in one provider from say 101 to 
105 you would still use its original number if accessing it from a CustomMix file of another 
provider.

So to sum up, only use a CustomLCN file for allocating LCNs. For everything else use CustomMix.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CustomLCN
---------

CustomLCN allows channels to be moved around within one single provider. CustomLCN is  
for providers that don't transmit logical channel numbers (e.g. Sky DE). Its purpose is
to insert logical channel numbers. The CustomLCN list can be complete or partial. 
It doesn't have to be in any particular order but having it sequential will make it 
easier to avoid making errors.

Each time ABM runs it makes an example CustomLCN xml file for each provider that is scanned, 
e.g. 'EXAMPLE_hd_sat_freesat_CustomLCN.xml'. These files are archived in:
/usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/SystemPlugins/AutoBouquetsMaker/custom
To make your own custom LCN file just delete 'EXAMPLE_' from the filename, 
i.e. hd_sat_freesat_CustomLCN.xml. Configurations in the provider xml file, such as channel swap, 
etc, are done after CustomLCN has been processed.

The following is how to edit the file. Just cut and paste the lines into the order you want. 
DO NOT add any channels into more than one place in the list.

Also don't forget to include the ABM custom folder in your backups otherwise your newly 
created file may be lost during image updates.

This is an example of the original 'EXAMPLE_" file:
<custom>
	<include>yes</include>
	<lcnlist>
		<configuration lcn="101" channelnumber="101" description="BBC One Lon"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="102" channelnumber="102" description="BBC Two HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="103" channelnumber="103" description="ITV"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="104" channelnumber="104" description="Channel 4"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="105" channelnumber="105" description="Channel 5"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="106" channelnumber="106" description="BBC Three HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="107" channelnumber="107" description="BBC Four HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="108" channelnumber="108" description="BBC One HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="109" channelnumber="109" description="BBC Two Eng"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="110" channelnumber="110" description="BBC ALBA"></configuration>

This is how to swap channels.		
If you want to swap ITV (103) with BBC Three HD (106) cut and paste both lines.
<custom>
	<include>yes</include>
	<lcnlist>
		<configuration lcn="101" channelnumber="101" description="BBC One Lon"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="102" channelnumber="102" description="BBC Two HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="106" channelnumber="106" description="BBC Three HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="104" channelnumber="104" description="Channel 4"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="105" channelnumber="105" description="Channel 5"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="103" channelnumber="103" description="ITV"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="107" channelnumber="107" description="BBC Four HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="108" channelnumber="108" description="BBC One HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="109" channelnumber="109" description="BBC Two Eng"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="110" channelnumber="110" description="BBC ALBA"></configuration>

Now change the lcn numbers. lcn numbers should be in order to avoid errors!!
<custom>
	<include>yes</include>
	<lcnlist>
		<configuration lcn="101" channelnumber="101" description="BBC One Lon"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="102" channelnumber="102" description="BBC Two HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="103" channelnumber="106" description="BBC Three HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="104" channelnumber="104" description="Channel 4"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="105" channelnumber="105" description="Channel 5"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="106" channelnumber="103" description="ITV"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="107" channelnumber="107" description="BBC Four HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="108" channelnumber="108" description="BBC One HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="109" channelnumber="109" description="BBC Two Eng"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="110" channelnumber="110" description="BBC ALBA"></configuration>

Removing channels.
Channel removal only applies to unsorted lists, i.e. non-LCN providers where the list has not been 
sorted in any way. To remove a channel, just delete the line. NOTE: When <include>is set to 'yes', 
all channels not configured in the custom xml will be added at the end of the main bouquet. This way 
also new services from the provider will be added at the end of the channel list. Any new channels 
will be shown in the ABM log.

Changing 'channel numbers'.
If you want your own numbering, edit the lcn numbers. lcn numbers should be in order to avoid errors!!
<custom>
	<include>no</include>
	<lcnlist>
		<configuration lcn="1" channelnumber="101" description="BBC One Lon"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="2" channelnumber="102" description="BBC Two HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="3" channelnumber="103" description="ITV"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="4" channelnumber="104" description="Channel 4"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="5" channelnumber="105" description="Channel 5"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="6" channelnumber="106" description="BBC Three HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="7" channelnumber="107" description="BBC Four HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="8" channelnumber="108" description="BBC One HD"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="9" channelnumber="109" description="BBC Two Eng"></configuration>
		<configuration lcn="10" channelnumber="110" description="BBC ALBA"></configuration>

NOTE: Be aware of correct sections in the provider xml.
e.g.
	<sections>
		<section number="101">Entertainment</section>
		<section number="200">News and Sport</section>
		<section number="300">Movies</section>
		<section number="400">Lifestyle</section>
		<section number="500">Music</section>
		<section number="600">Children</section>
		<section number="650">Special Interest</section>
		<section number="800">Shopping</section>
		<section number="870">Adult</section>
		<section number="950">Regional</section>
	</sections>

Your lcn numbering should match sections. In this example you can add a custom section.
	<sections>
		<section number="1">Custom list</section>
		<section number="101">Entertainment</section>
		<section number="200">News and Sport</section>
		<section number="300">Movies</section>
		<section number="400">Lifestyle</section>
		<section number="500">Music</section>
		<section number="600">Children</section>
		<section number="650">Special Interest</section>
		<section number="800">Shopping</section>
		<section number="870">Adult</section>
		<section number="950">Regional</section>
	</sections>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CustomMix
---------

CustomMiX allows TV channels from one provider to be added to the bouquets of another provider. 
This is great if you mainly use one provider but want to add a few channels from other providers 
but don't want to create a complete list for the other provider. All providers that you want to 
receive channels from must be included in every ABM scan but if you don't want complete bouquets 
from that provider just set all the bouquet creation options to no.

CustomMix can also be used to move channels around interanally within one single provider.

For each provider you wish to add channels to, you need to add an xml configuration file. The xml
configuration files reside in /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/SystemPlugins/AutoBouquetsMaker/custom 
and filenames are made up as follows... "provider_key_CustomMix.xml", e.g. for Sky UK the filename 
would be "sat_282_sky_uk_CustomMix.xml". For other providers please consult the list of provider 
keys below.

This is an example xml configuration file for Sky UK. Filename as above. 

<custommix>
	<inserts>
		<insert provider="cable_uk_virgin" source="150" target="171"></insert> <!-- channel5 hd -->
		<insert provider="cable_uk_virgin" source="110" target="106"></insert> <!-- sky one hd -->
	</inserts>
	<deletes>
		<delete target="170"></delete> <!-- Sky 3D -->
	</deletes>
</custommix>

The "insert" lines are what do the work but all the tags must be present.
The "insert" line has 3 attributes, "provider", "source", and "target".

"provider" is the key of provider from which the channel is being imported. See below for a list of provider keys.
"source" is the channel number being imported.
"target" is the slot in the Sky UK bouquet into which that channel will be inserted.

Each channel that is to be moved requires an "insert" line.

"Delete" lines allow you to remove individual channels from the provider you are customising. Just
set "target" to the number of the channel you want to remove and it will disappear on the next scan.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Favourites
----------

Favourites allows the creation of a complete favourites list that will preceed all other ABM bouquets. 
Please note, favourites lists are static. ABM will keep your favourites list up to date if there are 
changes to service references and transponder parameters but obviously it is not going to be updated 
if new channels start broadcasting, so any new channels you want in the list must be added manually.

Channels selected for the favourites list can come from any providers that are being scanned, and these 
providers must be scanned on every ABM run. The filename of the configuration file is "favourites.xml"
It must be placed in: /usr/lib/enigma2/python/Plugins/SystemPlugins/AutoBouquetsMaker/custom/

Here is an example favourites.xml file.

<favourites>
	<name>My List</name>
	<sections>
		<section number="100">Entertainment</section>
		<section number="200">Movies</section>
		<section number="300">Music</section>
		<section number="400">Sports</section>
		<section number="500">News</section>
		<section number="600">Documentaries</section>
		<section number="700">Kids</section>
		<section number="800">Other</section>
	</sections>
	<inserts>
		<insert provider="sat_282_sky_uk" source="105" target="105"></insert> <!-- channel5 hd -->
		<insert provider="sat_282_sky_uk" source="106" target="206"></insert> <!-- sky one hd -->
	</inserts>
	<bouquets>
		<main>1</main> <!-- 0 or 1 -->
		<sections>1</sections> <!-- 0 or 1 -->
	</bouquets>
</favourites>

"name" is the prefix of you favourites bouquets if you have "prefix" enabled in the ABM menu. "sections" 
is used for writing the section markers to your bouquets. You must have at least one section, and only 
channels with a greater channel number than the first section number will be added to your favourites 
bouquets. The "insert" lines have 3 attributes, "provider", "source", and "target". "provider" is the 
key of provider from which the channel is being imported. See below for a list of provider keys. "source" 
is the channel number being imported. And "target" is the slot in the favourites into which that channel 
will be inserted. Each channel that is to be moved requires an "insert" line. 

"bouquets" -> "main" has a value of 0 or 1. "0" means no main bouquet will be created and "1" that one 
will. Same for "bouquets" -> "sections". If "bouquets" -> "sections" is enabled the favourites list will 
be divided up into sections bouquets as per the section numbers above. 

All tags in the above example are necessary to get this working.

By default the favourites bouquet preceeds all other ABM bouquets, but it is also possible to place it after 
another provider. Use a placement tag to do this and just add the number of the provider you want it to follow.

<favourites>
	<!-- default fields go here as in above example -->
	<placement>2</placement>
</favourites>




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hacks
-----

"Hacks" is available in "Favourites" and "CustomMix". "Hacks" allows Python code to be use to 
modify the channel list and sections markers, sort channels by name, make a "+1" bouquet, etc, etc, 
and that this can be done dynamically rather than just creating static lists. With "Hacks" the sky 
really is the limit in what bouquets can be created by ABM. Here's how "Hacks" looks in a CustomMix
file.

<custommix>
	<hacks>
<![CDATA[

# Python code here

]]>
	</hacks>
</custommix>

"Hacks" is provided for those with the ability to use it and there will only be basic support 
for this feature.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Streams
-------

"Streams" is available in "CustomMix". Sometimes a channel may not be available to you, e.g. you might be
outside the satellite footprint, but you can access it via a stream. In these cases use a "stream" tag. 

"url" may be an encoded or non encoded url.
"target" is the number of the channel you wish to attach the url stream to.
"name" is the name to be used for the stream service. (Only used when adding to empty LCN slots).

To replace a DVB service, the layout would be as below.
The name and service reference will be the same as the DVB service. This will allow EPG data and picons to also work for the stream.

<custommix>
	<streams>
		<stream url="http://stream.source:port/live/username/F36/password/308.ts" target="118" />
	</streams>
</custommix>


You can also give your stream a "service reference type". This allows you to tell the receiver which playback software to use for that individual stream.

In this example "servicereftype" has been added:

<custommix>
	<streams>
		<stream url="http://stream.source:port/live/username/F36/password/308.ts" target="118" servicereftype="4097" />
	</streams>
</custommix>

The following is a list of currently valid "service reference types":
	1		processed by the SoC (for when buffering is not required)
	4097	processed by gstreamer via servicemp3
	5001	processed by gstreamer via gst-player
	5002	processed via extplayer3

You can also add streams into empty LCN slots. As these do not have a name from the DVB source, it has to be specified.
When inserting streams into empty LCN slots, the service reference will be "1:0:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:".
EPG will not work becuase of this.

In this example we have added a section/bouquet too.

<custommix>
    <sections>
        <section number="700">IPTV</section>
    </sections>

    <streams>
        <stream url="http://stream.source:port/live/username/F36/password/308.ts" target="701" name="our name 1" />
        <stream url="http://stream.source:port/live/username/F36/password/309.ts" target="702" name="our name 2" />
    </streams>
</custommix>

lamedb (v4) format explained
----------------------------

Lamedb format:
	File is basically a fixed format file where some fields contain multiple values separated by commas or colons. Lines may not exceed 256 characters.
	It contains two sections.
	Transponders started by a line transponders. Contains transponder frequencies, symbol rates, polarization and satellite position.
	Services started by a line services. Contains SSID, Card ID for channels on a particular transponder.

Header Line:
	The file starts with a line eDVB services /%d/, where %d is format version.
	eDVB services /4/
	
Transponders section:
	Section starts with a line transponders.
	Followed by a DVB line and transponder data line tuples. The DVB data line starts at col 0, the transponder data line immediately follows and starts with a <TAB>.
	Lines starting at col0 contains three fields encoded in hexadecimal:

		DVB namespace
		Transport stream id
		Original network id


	Lines starting with a <TAB> character and contain DVB transponder data such as frequency and symbol rate. Three types of DVB transponders can be encoded here:

		Satellite DVB
		Terestrial DVB
		Cable DVB

	Satellite lines start with <TAB>s like: s 10773250:22000000:0:2:192:2:0:1:2:0:2 fields for version 3 and 4. All fields are separated by colons, values in decimal.

		Frequency in Hertz.
		Symbol rate in bits per second.
		Polarization: 0=Horizontal, 1=Vertical, 2=Circular Left, 3=Circular right.

		Flags


Services section:
	The section starts with the word services on a line by itself.
	Followed by a three line tuple: DVB stream data, Channel name, Provider data line.
	The DVB stream data line contains six fields:

		Service id (SSID value from stream) in Hex
		DVB namespace in Hex.
		Transport stream id in Hex
		Original network id in Hex
		Service type in Decimal: 1=TV, 2=Radio
		Service number in Decimal.


	The Channel name is on a line by itself in some character encoding (to be investigated, probably UTF-8)
	The last line contains Provider Service data. Variable number of fields, separated by commas. Fields formed like <tag>:value. For example p:Sky Digital,c:000202,c:010282,c:020242,c:030202,c:0500 01,C:0963,C:0961,C:0960.

dxIsScrambledPMT=1024, // Hmm ( something to do with 27.5W ??? )
dxCenterDVBSubs=2048, // Centre DVB subtitles

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

swapchannels (in providers.xml)
-------------------------------

swapchannels always forces the channel order in the HD bouquets, and optionally forces the 
channel order main and sections bouquets. "number" is the SD channel. "with" is the HD channel. 
Swap will only occur if the source channel is not HD and the target channel is HD, and both ends 
of the swap exist.

Example:
<channel number="101" with="801"/> <!-- BBC One HD -->
This moves "BBC One HD" to slot 101, and BBC One London to slot 801.

There is also a "conditional" attribute.
Example:
<channel number="102" with="802" conditonal="service_hd['channel_id'] == 2075"/> <!-- BBC Two HD -->
If the statement in the conditional attribute evaluates to True the swap will occur, if not it 
will fail.

It is also possible to create compound statements.
Example:
<channel number="102" with="802" conditonal="service_sd['service_name'] == 'BBC Two Eng" and service_hd['channel_id'] == 2075"/>

The following is a non-exhaustive list of variables that could be used in a conditional attribute, 
although not all will be available for all providers.

service_sd['service_name']
service_sd['channel_id']
service_sd['service_id']
service_sd['transport_stream_id']
service_sd['provider_name']
service_sd['category_name']
service_sd['original_network_id']
service_sd['bouquet_id']
service_sd['bouquet_key']

service_hd['service_name']
service_hd['channel_id']
service_hd['service_id']
service_hd['transport_stream_id']

Freesat, special config for people outside the footprint of the home transponder
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For people that are outside the footprint of the freesat home transponder an alternative 
configuration is needed. This is much slower than using the standard configuration but 
at least it allows the scan to collect the relevant data, which would not be possible 
otherwise.

In the Freesat provider file, in the transponder section, 
delete:
    sdt_pid="0xbba"
    bat_pid="0xbba"

add:
    bat_pid="0xf01"

Convert the rest of the transponder parameters to those of a transponder known to be 
available on your dish. e.g. Sky News transponder (12207 V 27500 2/3).

Basically the above just reverts this commit:

DVB-T frequency finder
----------------------

This tool enables the creation of a provider file for UK terrestrial for users that live 
in areas where the data contained in the supplied system file or SI tables may be incomplete 
or wrong. This will be the case if you are receiving from a repeater or when there have been 
modifications to the active frequencies on your mast that the ABM developers are not yet aware 
of.

To enable the tool go into the configure menu, select "Expert" mode, and then select
"Show DVB-T frequency finder".

Then in the main ABM menu select "DVB-T frequency finder". The tool automatically steps through 
all known UHF TV frequencies and works out where ABM needs to look for services. This process 
takes a few minutes to complete. Once it is complete the tool creates a new provider file and 
advises you of the name. Now it is just a question of going into the Providers menu and de-selecting 
"FreeView (UK)" and then selecting the newly created provider, and doing a scan. You only need 
to run the tool one time and from then on just let ABM scan in the normal way. If at a later 
stage there seams to be something wrong with the channels you are receiving, such as a block of 
channels with no signal just run the tool again.

And dont forget to push the created file back to the developers on OpenViX forum along with your 
location and opinion of which mast you are receiving from.
